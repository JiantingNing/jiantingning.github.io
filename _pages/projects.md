## Projects
The following is a not exhaustive list of projects where I have been involved. It includes international and national fund projects, as well as personal software projects.

#### MicroPython Libraries and Drivers Series
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/project-software-green">

The upy-series (read it as micropy series) is a collection of libraries and drivers built for MicroPython-based boards (i.e., ESP32, RP2040, etc.). It includes, i.e., drivers for YL-69 or HL-69 resistive soil moisture sensor.

Catch up the piece of software you need to integrate in your project and open an issue if you find one.
