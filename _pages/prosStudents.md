I am interested in a wide range of research topics in cyber security, and I am always looking for self-motivated students. 

### For prospective students
I totally understand your eagerness to get accepted to start your Ph.D. journey as early as possible (I have had the same experience at your age), but this is just not how the scholarship selection and admission process work. As a research student, you need to invest a huge amount of time in researching the scholarship selection and admission process of your target supervisor and university/organization. At this stage, my experience and advice could help you accelerate this process and make you more competitive in selection. So, I recommend you drop me an email to express your interest sooner rather than later.
