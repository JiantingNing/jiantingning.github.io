This is Lorenzo! I am a Research Fellow in <a href="https://fcrlab.unime.it/">FCRLab</a> at <a href="https://international.unime.it/">University of Messina</a>. I earned my Ph.D. in the Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics and Hearth Sciences under the supervision of <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=12645423500">Professor Massimo Villari</a> in May 2020.

I used to act as Researcher since the beginning of my carrier, publishing about Cloud Computing, Edge Computing, Internet of Things and Distributed Systems of all kinds, as well as Artificial Intelligence, Intelligent Systems and Robotics.

My current research focuses on the collaboration between humans and ambient intelligence.

I am reviewer of respected Springer, IEEE and Elsevier Journals, and co-author of more than 20 manuscripts.
